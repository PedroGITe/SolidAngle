# SolidAngle
Code to calculate de absolute and relative solid angle of an off axis source point subtended by a circular disk

Disk Radius = rm
Offset from the disk axis = ra
Distance from the source point to the desk in the disk axis direction = L


!!only valid for values offset from axis below 2 times the radius of the circular disk and for values of the distance of the source point to the disk from half to two time the value for the desk radius!! 

-->0 <= ra/rm <= 2--<
-->0.5 <= L/rm <= 2 --<
